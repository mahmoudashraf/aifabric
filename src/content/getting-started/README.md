# AI Fabric Getting Started

This directory is the canonical, versioned Getting Started path for AI Fabric.
It is written for two readers:

- A developer integrating AI Fabric into a Spring Boot application.
- An LLM coding assistant that needs a small, reliable context pack before editing code.

Current assumptions:

- AI Fabric version: `0.3.3`
- Java: `21`
- Spring Boot: `4.1.x`
- Maven group: `io.github.loom-ai-labs`

## Fast Path

1. Read [LLM Start Here](00-llm-start-here.md) if an AI coding assistant is helping.
2. Read [Choose Your Path](01-choose-your-path.md) to pick the smallest module set.
3. Add dependencies from [Installation](02-installation.md).
4. Build one vertical slice:
   - [First Semantic Search](03-first-semantic-search.md)
   - [First RAG Chat](04-first-rag-chat.md)
   - [First Governed Action](05-first-governed-action.md)
5. Add production guardrails from [Production Checklist](13-production-checklist.md).
