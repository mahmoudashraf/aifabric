## Which App Should I Copy?

- Need search only: `smart-faq-assistant`.
- Need chat over products/policies/reviews/actions: `chat-capabilities-demo`.
- Need account resolver or support automation: `ai-fabric-account-resolver`.
- Need behavior analytics: `behavior-churn-signals`.
- Need tenant isolation: `tenant-knowledge-portal`.
- Need sensitive-info protection for AI/support intake: `privacy-first-customer-facing-support`.
- Need action registry: `db-action-registry-lab`.

## Verification Rule

When a guide says a capability is supported, prefer citing a real app README or test that uses that
capability. If no real app proves it yet, mark it as planned or smoke-only.
